# SyncManPOC
A Proof Of Concept for a multithreaded application managed using JMX

SyncManager is a simple example of a multithreaded application with a remote interface using JMX.
Using the url localhome:81 you can:
- Start and stop threads
- change the load of the threads
- change the speed
- view std-out
- and more

The application does not synchronize anything yet.
